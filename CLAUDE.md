We are building a landing page for the prelaunch of a kickstarter screenless wearable health tracker which will compete with whoop.

You can see our market research on potential users at market.md, note that although we will be mostly the same we will be different in these ways:
 - one time purchase only (no subscription)
 - affordable
 - long battery life >10 days
 - highly reliable heart rate sensor. we will use our research to demonstrate this (R value = 0.96 best in industry for difficult to track activity in gym)
 - we will use activity quotient (the successor to PAI) to give users a target to maintain health and fitness. an AQ of 100 has been scientifically shown to increase lifespan by 13 years

 - will work offline
 - will include smart wakeup alarm
