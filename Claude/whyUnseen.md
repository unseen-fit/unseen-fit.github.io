# Why UNSEEN?

## Overview

UNSEEN represents a fundamental shift in health tracking technology. Unlike traditional wearables that compete for wrist space and require constant interaction, UNSEEN operates invisibly on your upper arm, delivering medical-grade insights without disrupting your life. Here's why UNSEEN is the smart choice for anyone serious about their health.

## 1. No Subscriptions - True Ownership

### The Problem with Subscriptions
Most health tracking solutions lock you into monthly or annual subscriptions, creating ongoing financial commitments that can add up to hundreds of dollars over time. Many also gate essential features behind premium paywalls.

### UNSEEN's Solution
- **One-time purchase**: Buy once, own forever
- **No hidden fees**: What you see is what you pay
- **Lifetime app support**: Continuous updates and improvements included
- **No feature restrictions**: All capabilities available from day one
- **True ownership**: Your device, your data, your control

### Financial Impact
Over 5 years, subscription-based solutions can cost $600-1200. UNSEEN's one-time purchase model saves you money while delivering superior technology.

## 2. Upper Arm Placement - Free Your Wrist

### The Wrist Problem
Traditional smartwatches and fitness trackers compete with your existing timepieces, professional requirements, and personal style. They're often bulky, distracting, and can interfere with daily activities.

### UNSEEN's Revolutionary Approach

- **Fashion-conscious**: Preserve personal style without compromise

## 3. Activity Index - Revolutionary Health Metric

### Beyond Step Counting
Traditional fitness trackers focus on basic metrics like steps, calories, and heart rate. These provide limited insight into overall health and fitness levels.

### UNSEEN's Activity Index

## 4. Privacy and Data Control

### The Privacy Crisis in Health Tech
Many health tracking companies monetize user data through third-party partnerships, creating privacy concerns and potential security vulnerabilities.
