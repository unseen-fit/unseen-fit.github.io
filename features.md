## Cardio Index
Cardio Index is UNSEEN's  scoring system that measures the health impact of your endurance activities. It's based on your heart rate data and converts your physical effort into a meaningful health score that ranges from 0 to 100+.
Based on research with over 1 million participants and decades of data, Cardio Index provides the most accurate measure of physical activity's health impact available. It's designed to optimize your health span and longevity through evidence-based activity scoring.
- **Heart Rate Based**: Uses your personal heart rate curves from the past 7 days to measure effort
- **0-49**: Below optimal health impact
  - 0: No meaningful endurance activity in past 7 days
  - 25: Minimal health benefits
  - 49: Below average health impact
- **50-99**: Good health foundation
  - 50: Above average health impact
  - 75: Strong health benefits
  - 99: Excellent health foundation
- **100+**: Optimal health impact
  - 100: Best possible health benefits from physical activity
  - 100+: Maximum health optimization
1. **Minimum Threshold**: Only activities above ~60% max heart rate earn points. The type of activity doesnt matter.
2. **Intensity Matters**: Higher heart rate = more points per minute
3. **Duration Counts**: Longer sessions accumulate more points
4. **Frequency Rewarded**: Regular activity patterns score higher
5. **Personalized Effort**: Same relative effort = same score regardless of fitness level
- **7-day rolling window**: Score updates daily based on past week
- **Longevity Index**: Contributes to overall aging assessment
- **Streaks**: Maintain consistent scores
- **Badges**: Achieve milestone scores
- **Levels**: Progress through health tiers
- **Insights**: Personalized recommendations
- **Celebrations**: Achievement recognition


## Activity Logging - hybdrid model
Manual tracking initiated by pressing the button on the device. Tagging workout types are generally arbitrary. besides giving you the ability to count frequency of exercise done. The only thing you might want to do is decide weather you want GPs data for distance or not. We let you start activity tracking manually - this creates an activity and begins live HR reading with much higher precession and begins distance recording. When an activity is completed the user gets a post workout breakdown of high res contextual data regarding that activity. This is all optional, some users may decide to not manually track activities. For example it doesnt make much sense to track tennis unless you are trying to maintain or increase the number of tennis workouts per week, or want data specifically during the tennis workout. Otherwise it doesnt make sense to log a tennis activity.
Within tracked activities:
- Personal records
- frequency trends
- HR zones
- time
- cals 
- distance (if relevant)
- steps (if relevant)
