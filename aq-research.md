Abstract
Background
Regular physical activity (PA) is important for reducing the risk of chronic diseases and improving overall health. Activity Quotient (AQ) is a novel metric that translates heart rate during PA into a weekly score, providing an objective measure of an individual's PA. We prospectively examined the association of AQ with cancer and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality outcomes, the two major causes of death, in a Taiwanese population.
Methods
A cohort of 515,608 healthy adults (52 % women) enrolled in a standard medical screening program was followed for mortality outcomes. The weekly AQ score of each participant was estimated based on self-reported PA intensity and weekly duration, and placed into six categories (0, ≤50, 51–99,100–149, 150–199, or ≥ 200 AQ per week). We used multivariable Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for potential confounders to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI).
Results
Higher weekly AQ scores were associated with lower risks of CVD, cancer, and all-cause mortalities. Compared with inactive individuals, HRs (CI) for the association of AQ scores of ≤50, 50–99, 100–149, 150–199, and ≥ 200 were 0.93 (0.89–0.97), 0.91 (0.85–0.96), 0.84 (0.77–0.91), 0.84 (0.74–0.96), and 0.81 (0.73–0.90) with cancer mortality; and 0.88 (0.83–0.93), 0.86 (0.80–0.93), 0.81 (0.73–0.90), 0.71 (0.60–0.85), and 0.73 (0.64–0.84) with CVD mortality, respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that meeting 50 AQ a week was associated with lower risk of disease specific mortality risk across age groups and among individuals with known risk factors. Higher weekly AQ scores were also associated with longer life expectancy, with the highest gains observed among those achieving 150–199 weekly AQ.
Conclusion
Our findings show that AQ may be an objective tool for assessing and tracking PA and predicting mortality risks. Encouraging individuals to achieve ≥50 AQ a week could have substantial public health benefits, including lower mortality from major chronic diseases as well as prolonged health- and life expectancy.

Introduction
Engaging in regular physical activity (PA) has been proven to be an effective way to reduce the risk of developing non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, and cancer, which are the leading causes of death and disability worldwide.1, 2, 3, 4 Lack of PA results in significant economic costs for healthcare systems and the global economy through healthcare expenses and lost productivity.5 Despite the known advantages of PA, a considerable proportion of the global population falls short of the recommended levels set by the World Health Organization (WHO).6
The WHO's Global Status Report on Physical Activity 20225 recommends the utilization of digital and wearable technologies to provide individuals with guidance and support to adopt healthy lifestyles and behavioral changes. These technologies offer new opportunities for health promotion and can reach a large number of people at relatively low cost, potentially transforming healthcare services. Despite criticism and skepticism regarding their effectiveness, a recent systematic review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses found that the clinical benefits associated with activity wearables are significant and sustained over time.7
Personal activity intelligence (PAI) – an activity metric – was originally developed to quantify the level of PA, in relation to subsequent health outcomes and mortality.8,9 The PAI system incorporated individualized data such as age, sex, resting and maximal heart rate, and heart rate response to PA to generate a weekly score (e.g., 0 PAI score indicates inactive, and 100 PAI score indicates beneficially active). The score informs individuals whether they have achieved the recommended amount of PA to prevent non-communicable diseases, improve survival, or both.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18
With the advancement in the PA research, it became clear to us that a more refined activity metric was needed, leading to the evolution of Activity Quotient (AQ). The AQ system builds on principles beyond PAI by incorporating much more sophisticated algorithms, accounting for individual variability in fitness levels, health status, robust age-related risk estimates, and allows for a more nuanced interpretation of health effects of PA. The association between AQ and mortality outcomes in a general population is not known. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the association between AQ and mortality in a large cohort in Taiwan, with a specific focus on mortality outcomes related to CVD and cancer.
Methods
Study participants
The study cohort successively recruited 636,064 participants from a medical screening program (MJ Health Management Institution, Taipei, Taiwan) between 1994 and 2017. Participants with missing baseline PA data were excluded, leaving 515,608 participants (268,788 women and 246,820 men) aged 20 years and older for CVD and all-cause mortality outcomes. We further excluded 5793 participants with a baseline history of cancer and studied 509,815 participants (264,665 women and 245,150 men) for cancer mortality outcomes.
Every participant in the study provided informed consent and authorized the MJ Health Management Institution to process data on the medical screening results. Institutional Review Boards at both the MJ Health Management Institution and the National Health Research Institute in Taiwan reviewed and approved the ethical aspects of the study. To ensure the anonymity of the study participants, we removed personally identifiable information from the dataset, which remained anonymous throughout the study's duration.
Clinical characteristics, measurements and questionnaire-based information
Study participants underwent physical examinations, body measurements, functional tests, and blood chemistry analyses and filled in a self-administered questionnaire about their medical history and lifestyle information. Blood pressure (BP) was measured in a sitting position after resting for five minutes or more. Hypertension was defined as having a systolic/diastolic BP ≥140/90 mmHg or a history of hypertension. Diabetes was defined as having a fasting blood glucose ≥126 mg/dL (≥7 mmol/L) or a history of diabetes. An individual consuming two or more alcoholic drinks a day on three or more days a week was regarded as a regular drinker, and consuming less than a regular drinker was regarded an occasional drinker.
Activity Quotient (AQ)
Information on leisure-time PA was obtained by self-reported questionnaires. We adopted activity-specific metabolic equivalents (METs; 1 MET = 3.5 mL O2 per min per kg) available from Ainsworth's Compendium of Physical Activities to classify the intensity of activity based on specific PA.19,20 Participants were asked to select from four intensity categories (each category is provided with examples) and the associated frequency (days per week) and duration (minutes per day) during the previous month: light (2.5 METs, e.g., causal walking), moderate (4.5 METs, e.g., brisk walking), medium-vigorous (6.5 METs, e.g., jogging), or high-vigorous (8.5 METs, e.g., running). For individuals who reported activities in more than one intensity category, a weighted MET value was assigned, dependent on the length of time engaged in each category.19 Using METs as an independent variable with adjusted values of for example 2.5, 4.2, 6.9, and 8.5 METs and percentages of heart rate reserve (%HRR)9 as a dependent variable with values of 44 %, 55 %, 73 %, and 85 % for relative intensity of low, medium-moderate, moderate and vigorous, we developed a linear regression equation to estimate %HRR from METs with a R2 of 0.9999. The regression equation approximates an individual's reported PA intensity (METs) to relative intensity (%HRR). The PA volume (MET-hours per week) was calculated by multiplying an individual's PA intensity (METs) with weekly durations. Each individual's AQ score was calculated by combining the weekly exercise volumes with the intensity calculations using the %HRR.
Ascertainment of outcomes
Participants were followed from baseline examination date until date of event or 31st December 2020, whichever came first. Each individual's identification number was matched with the National Death file and the National Cancer Registry file, and causes of death were classified according to International Classification of Diseases, 9th & 10th version (ICD-9 & ICD 10). The main outcomes in the analyses were CVD (ICD 9, 390–459; ICD 10, I00-I99), cancer (ICD 9, 140–239; ICD 10, C00-D49), and mortality from all-causes.
Statistical analyses
Baseline characteristics of participants are presented as mean (SD) for continuous variables, and number (%) for categorical variables. We categorized participants into six groups according to their weekly AQ score: 0 (inactive), ≤50, 51–99, 100–149, 150–199, or ≥ 200. The choice of these specific cut points was made ‘a priori’ based on prior research, and then expanded upon to investigate the association between AQ and incident mortality.9,17 The inactive (0 AQ) group was used as control or reference cohort. We used Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age, BMI (<18.5, 18.5–24.9, 25.0–29.9, or ≥30 kg/m2), smoking status (never, former or current), education attainment (middle school or below, high school, junior college, college or above), hypertension status (no, yes), diabetes status (no, yes), hypercholesterolemia (yes, no), and alcohol consumption (non-drinker, occasional drinker or regular drinker) to assess the association between AQ and mortality, separately for men and women. The proportional hazards assumption was examined and satisfied by plotting the log minus log survival curves and survival times against cumulative survival. Results are reported as hazard ratios (HR) and precision of estimates as 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). To estimate the life expectancy, we used life table methods.19
We also conducted analyses in subgroups of participants: age (20 to <40, 40 to <60, 60 to 69 or ≥70 years) and those with known risk factors of mortality such as hypertension, smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or overweight and obesity. In another analysis, we categorized participants into groups of 0, >0 to <15, 15 to <25, or 25 to 50 weekly AQ to assess the association between relatively low AQ levels and all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality. To reduce the potential for bias caused by reverse causation and to test the strength of our results, we conducted sensitivity analyses by excluding deaths that occurred during the first three-year follow-up period, and also conducted the analyses after excluding participants with a history of CVD at baseline. All statistical tests were two-sided, with P-values less than 0.05 considered significant, and statistical analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.2.
Based on self-regulation theory, that builds upon personal-oriented and social-oriented users' health behaviors and well-being, findings from this study, and several internal pilot studies to tune the algorithm from questionnaires to real-life heart rate monitoring, Mia Health Inc. (miahealth.no/en/), a NTNU- [ntnu.edu] and SINTEF- [sintef.no/en] spin off company, developed and released an application that features AQ. In a pilot study of the first 62, 347 (53 % women) downloaders of the Mia app, we present adherence rate after 3-, 6, − and 12 months of use.
Results
Baseline characteristics of the individuals according to AQ scores are presented in Table 1. Among the 515,608 (52.1 % women) study participants, 7.5 % (n = 38,915) achieved a weekly ≥100 AQ score, and 2.2 % (n = 11,466) achieved a weekly AQ score of 200 or more. Compared to inactive (0 AQ) individuals, those with high weekly AQ scores had lower prevalence of obesity (4.5 % inactive versus 3.7 %, 3.8 % and 3.2 % in those with weekly AQ scores of 100–149, 150–199 and ≥ 200, respectively), higher levels of college education (32.1 % inactive versus 34.3 % and 47.7 % in those with weekly AQ scores of 100–149 and 150–199, respectively), and lower prevalence of current smoking (24.4 % inactive versus 17.8 % in those with weekly AQ score of 100–149).

AQ, Activity Quotient.
During a median follow-up of 16.8 (IQR, 12.2–21.2) years, there were 40,227 deaths (23,054 in men and 17,173 in women). The underlying cause of death was CVD in 8479 participants (4882 in men and 3597 in women), and cancer in 13,790 participants (7970 in men and 5820 in women). Compared with the inactive group (0 AQ), high levels of weekly AQ were associated with lower risk of CVD, cancer and all-cause mortality (Table 2, Table 3, sTable 1). Compared with inactive group, the HRs for CVD mortality associated with weekly AQ scores of 100–149, 150–199 and ≥ 200 were 0.81 (95 % CI, 0.73–0.90), 0.71 (0.60–0.85), and 0.73 (0.64–0.84), respectively. Among men and women, the corresponding HRs were 0.78 (0.67–0.91), 0.71 (0.59–0.86), 0.81 (0.70–0.95) and 0.83 (0.72–0.95), 0.64 (0.39–1.07), 0.54 (0.40–0.72), respectively (Table 2).

The association between AQ and cancer mortality is presented in Table 3. Compared with the inactive group, the HRs associated with weekly AQ scores of, 100–149, 150–199 and ≥200 were 0.84 (0.77–0.91), 0.84 (0.74–0.96), and 0.81 (0.73–0.90), respectively. In men, we found the similar pattern as for the total cohort and corresponding HRs were 0.80 (0.70–0.91), 0.80 (0.69–0.93), and 0.84 (0.75–0.95). However, only those women with weekly AQ score of ≥200 had lower risk of cancer mortality (HR, 0.74; 95 CI, 0.61–0.91), compared with the inactive counterparts (Table 3).
The HRs for all-cause mortality associated with weekly AQ scores of 100–149, 150–199 and ≥200 were 0.78 (0.74–0.82), 0.74 (0.68–0.80) and 0.75 (0.71–0.80), respectively, compared with inactive participants. The corresponding HRs for men and women were 0.76 (0.71–0.82), 0.73 (0.66–0.79), 0.79 (0.73–0.85) and 0.81 (0.75–0.86), 0.78 (0.63–0.96), 0.68 (0.60–0.77), respectively (sTable 1).
The weekly AQ scores of less than 100 were also associated with lower risk of mortality. For CVD mortality, HRs associated with weekly AQ scores of ≤50 and 51–99 were 0.88 (0.83–0.93), and 0.86 (0.80–0.93), respectively, and the corresponding HRs for cancer mortality were 0.93 (0.89–0.97), and 0.91 (0.85–0.96), respectively (Table 2, Table 3). For all-cause mortality, HRs associated with weekly AQ scores of ≤50 and 51–99 were 0.89 (0.87–0.91), and 0.88 (0.85–0.91), respectively (sTable 1). The results of the weekly AQ scores (>0–50) with mortality are shown in sTable 2. Compared with inactive individuals, HRs for all-cause mortality were 0.91 (0.88–0.95), 0.93 (0.89–0.97), and 0.85 (0.83–0.88) in participants with weekly AQ scores of >0 to <15, 15 to <25, and 25 to 50, respectively (sTable 2). For CVD and cancer mortality, corresponding HRs were 0.92 (0.84–1.01), 0.94 (0.86–1.04), 0.82 (0.77–0.89) and 0.92 (0.86–0.99), 0.98 (0.91–1.05), 0.90 (0.86–0.96), respectively (sTable 2).
In subgroups of participants, high levels of weekly AQ scores were associated with lower risk of mortality (Fig. 1, Table 2, Table 3). For example, the HRs associated with ≤50, 5–99, 100–149, 150–199, and ≥200 AQ for CVD mortality among individuals ≥70 years-old were 0.84 (0.76–0.93), 0.82 (0.73–0.93), 0.72 (0.60–0.87), 0.56 (0.38–0.84), and 0.63 (0.47–0.85), respectively, compared with inactive. Similar trends were observed for age groups 40–59 years, and 60–69 years, and for all-cause and cancer mortality (Table 2, Table 3, sTable 1). For participants with established risk factors of mortality such as hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesteremia, smoking, and overweight/obesity; weekly high levels of AQ were associated with lower risk of mortality (Fig. 1). For cancer mortality among smokers, HRs associated with ≤50, 51–99, 100–149, 150–199, and ≥200 AQ were 0.89 (0.83–0.96), 0.87 (0.78–0.97), 0.80 (0.66–0.96), 0.76 (0.61–0.96), and 0.69 (0.56–0.84), respectively, compared with the inactive smokers (Fig. 1).

Life expectancy for men and women at age 30 years was 3.76 (3.71–3.81), and 2.94 (2.89–2.99) years longer, respectively, associated with weekly AQ score of 100–149 in comparison with the inactive individuals. For those at age 70, life expectancy was 2.56 (2.54–2.59) years longer in men and 3.02 (3.01–3.04) years longer in women, associated with weekly AQ score of 100–149. The highest gain in life-years across ages was found in individuals with weekly AQ score of 150–199 where men at 30 and 70 years had 4.48 (4.40–4.56) and 3.43 (3.38–3.48) longer years, respectively, and corresponding gained life years in women at 30 and 70 years were 4.27 (3.92–4.61) and 4.68 (4.47–4.88), respectively (Table 4).

Excluding the first three years of follow-up and results of analyses with self-reported healthy participants after excluding those with CVD at baseline did not materially change the effect estimates as shown in the sTables 3 and 4.
The results from using the Mia Health app showed a strong adherence rate, with 80 % of the first 62, 347 downloaders remaining engaged after 3 months, 79 % after 6 months, and 77 % still using the app after 12 months.
Discussion
In this large prospective study of healthy men and women at baseline, we found that high weekly AQ scores were associated with a significantly lower risk of mortality from all causes, CVD, and cancer. The protective effect of AQ was observed across diverse risk factor profiles and was associated with additional years of life gained.
Earlier studies investigating the association between different metrics of PA (subjective and objective METs, or PAI) and CVD mortality have shown a lower risk among individuals with high PA levels across diverse settings.3,4,8,9,13,14,21, 22, 23 Our findings related to CVD outcomes are in line with previous research, and further emphasize that AQ is a valuable metric for quantifying the health benefits of PA informing individuals about the impact of PA on their cardiovascular health.
The relationship between PA and cancer risk has been established previously.19,21,24, 25, 26, 27, 28 High energy-demanding PA, including aerobic and resistance exercise and an active lifestyle, are strongly associated with reducing the risk or impact of cancer disease, presumably related to improved mitochondrial function.26 We showed a graded association between weekly AQ and cancer mortality – compared with the inactive, each weekly AQ level was associated with reduced cancer mortality risk, bearing a dose-response relationship from <50 to ≥200 weekly AQ. A close examination showed that reducing cancer risks was more significant in the men and the 60-year and older subgroups. Dose-response relationships between PA and cancer mortality risks aligns with observations in a meta-analysis of 71 cohort studies,25 a pooled analysis from nine cohort studies,27 and a review study of cohort and case-control studies.28
In subgroups of participants of different age groups and those with known risk factors for premature mortality, high weekly AQ scores were associated with lower risk of mortality. These findings are consistent with the earlier reports9,13,19 showing protective role of high activity scores across subgroups of participants. Our results in subgroup of older individuals (60–69, ≥70 years) are of particular interest given the changing world demography with the expected increase in the number of older adults worldwide, and WHO focus on the ‘healthy ageing’ which centers on functional ability.29,30 The so-called functional ability is the combination of intrinsic capacity (physical and mental), relevant environmental characteristics, and interaction between the individual and these characteristics.29 In this regard, regular PA is recognized as one of the key behaviors influencing healthy ageing. Our results demonstrating that high weekly AQ scores were associated with significant gains in the life expectancy among older individuals further highlighted the applicability of AQ as a tool for promoting health and reducing mortality risk regardless of age or pre-existing health conditions. Further studies should investigate the association between AQ and functional ability in more detail.
Most of the exercisers (84.4 %) in our study had PA of <100 AQ a week, i.e., 64.8 % at ≤50 AQ, and 19.6 % at 51–99 AQ a week. Approximately, one-sixth (15.6 %) of the exercisers were at ≥100 AQ a week, i.e., 7.2 %, 3.8 %, 4.6 % achieved 100–149, 150–199, and ≥ 200 AQ a week, respectively. The observation that even score below 50 and 100 weekly AQ are associated with lower risk of mortality emphasize the importance of PA participation at varying intensities and durations. This may encourage individuals with physical limitations and others who may find it challenging to obtain higher AQ scores to partake in less vigorous PA to gain health benefits. Previous research also recognized the role of low levels of PA for mortality benefits,1,19,31,32 and suggested that a daily 15 min or cumulative 90 min per week of moderate intensity exercise was associated with significant health benefits.19 Paralleling with our findings of meeting 15 to <25 AQ a week, reduction of cancer mortality risk is also seen when meeting as low as 5 MET∙h per week.25 The present study highlights the potential role of AQ as a comprehensive activity metric for assessing health outcomes, including those related to CVD and cancer.
Similar to the PAI metric, the AQ emphasizes the importance of exercise intensity, which is associated with increase in cardiorespiratory fitness in a dose-response manner,33,34 in achieving greater health benefits.35,36 AQ refines this concept substantially by providing a more granular understanding of how different intensity levels impact overall health outcomes. AQ offers a more precise guideline, indicating that health benefits can be optimized without reaching maximal physical exertion, and with exercising at varying intensity levels, making AQ-guided PA more cost-effective than the conventional MET∙h metric. Also, the more robust data material than ever possible in the past PAI research, AQ offers, precise risk estimates for the huge population of people that is not able to reach 100 weekly AQ constantly.
The AQ metric is incorporated into wearable devices through a downloadable app that works with most Bluetooth-enabled heart rate monitors and is available globally. This app tracks heart rate variations over a 7-day rolling period to compute a personalized AQ-score for each user. The AQ system offers feedback on the number of points earned, and this information can be shared between clinicians and patients. This sharing aims to motivate and empower users to achieve a weekly AQ score of 50 or higher, which is associated with health benefits. The adherence to mobile PA apps varies depending on several factors, such as personalization, gamification, and ease of use.37,38 A meta-analysis of 28 randomized controlled trials with a mean duration of 13 weeks showed retention of PA apps between 61 % and 100 %.39 However, data from real world settings show that 50 % of individuals stop using the PA apps after 31 days,40 and 9 % to 60 % users remain engaged at six months.41,42 This decline continues with around 0.09 % to 29 % of users still active using the apps at 12 months.40, 41, 42 Of high interest, AQ seem to be a metric that motivate people to become and stay physically active as demonstrated by very high retention rates over long time-periods (around 80 % adherence after 12 months of use) of using the mobile app.
The study's primary strengths lie in its extensive cohort of healthy men and women, a thorough compilation of information regarding potential confounding factors, and the linkage to high-quality national registries to attain outcome data. Nevertheless, the study has some limitations. First, it is worth acknowledging that our study relies on epidemiological data to form recommendations for PA engagement. Due to its observational design, the reported findings do not imply causation. Second, AQ was derived from self-reported data on PA, which are subjected to recall and social desirability bias and may introduce susceptibility to classification bias. However, it should be noted that any misclassification is more likely to be non-differential, resulting in a conservative underestimation of the effect estimates. Third, unlike using a wearable device with an app, which objectively assess the relative exercise intensity (%HRR) from real-time measured heart rate parameters, our %HHR was retrospectively estimated by regression from reported activity intensity (METs). There may be potential estimation errors when applying a regression equation and transforming the %HHR to the AQ score. Therefore, long-term prospective studies and short-term randomized controlled trials on health outcomes of applying the AQ metric are recommended for future studies. Fourth, the AQ metric is developed based on endurance exercise and may not apply to muscle-resistive exercises. Fifth, unmeasured or unknown variables such as prescribed medications, diet, and biological and social factors may have introduced residual confounding. Sixth, as the cohort consists of participants belonging to an above-average socioeconomic status, the number of inactive participants within the cohort could potentially present an underestimation, limiting our findings' generalizability. Further, we observed no meaningful changes in the estimates after excluding events occurring during the first three years of follow-up or including only self-reported healthy participants, thereby reducing the likelihood of reverse causation bias.
Clinical and public health implications
Wearable devices promoting an active lifestyle may allow individuals to monitor and track their PA and motivate them to change their health behaviors.5,7 Incorporating AQ technology offers a simplified approach to guide people as to how much PA they need to undertake to protect them from inactivity-related diseases and premature mortality. The promotion of AQ can be considered a significant public health policy to motivate people to commence and maintain activity at sufficient levels,43,44 providing an additional solution in realizing the global objective of achieving a 15 % relative reduction in insufficient PA by 2030 among the adult population.5 Recent studies using objective measurements through wearable heart rate monitors and mobile applications have shown improvements in exercise capacity and sleep duration among individuals with type 2 diabetes,45 and increased PA levels among cardiac patients.46 Therefore, AQ recommendations and thresholds can be incorporated into PA assessments and prescriptions to maximize CVD and cancer mortality prevention.
Conclusion
Our study highlights the significant health benefits associated with higher weekly AQ scores, including lower risks of major causes of death and gaining additional years of life. Even modest AQ scores were associated with lower mortality risk, emphasizing the importance of engaging in some PA. Incorporating ≥50 AQ as weekly target, corresponding to a weekly 150 min of brisk walking, not only meets well with the current guideline but is also achievable, which is crucial in motivating and attracting many individuals to initiate and adhere to an active lifestyle.
